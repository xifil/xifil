# Fixing the campaign of Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare®

> *Since the Warzone deletion, the state of this game is in shambles, multiplayer works, but has texture loading issues, but campaign is the one that got railed the most.*

### 1. Ensure you have Spec-Ops installed alongside the Campaign

> This menu is accessed by right clicking the game in your library, clicking *Properties...*, then clicking *DLC*.

This was a bug since the launch of the Steam version (March 2023, long after the game was discontinued) and Infinity Ward most likely will not fix this either due to sheer incompetence or Activision.

### 2. Temporarily lower graphics settings

Navigate to *Options* `>` *Graphics* `>` *Quality*, then:
- Set *Streaming Quality* to *Low*

- Set *Texture Resolution* to *Very Low*

Press *F* to apply, or just click *Apply Settings* at the bottom of your screen.

### 3. Restart shaders installation

Now, you should be able to click *Restart Shaders Installation* and increase your *Texture Resolution* and *Streaming Quality* if you so desire.
